# HUJI From NAND to Tetris Course (67925)
My solutions for all the exercises for the From NAND to Tetris Course (67925) of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2023-2024 Fall Semester.
Note that most of the modifications HUJI made from the original NAND2Tetris course are around the Shift Left/Right operators.

If you're a fellow HUJI student who didn't complete the course - You're highly encouraged to exit this repository and solve everything by your own. I am in no way responsible for any outcome of using this code for your academics, whether you're HUJI student or not - Use at your own risk.
